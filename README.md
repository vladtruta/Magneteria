# Magneteria
Magneteria is a project I did for a friend from India, Brijesh Tiwari, who was a student at Game Design & Development at ICAT Design & Media College. He was in his final year, and so he had to design a game based on some given standards. I was responsible with the coding and implementation.

Brijesh gave me the assets (the maps, the character sprite sheets, and the music), a very well-written document explaining the game’s mechanics and how it should work. My job was to code a game out of that. I didn’t get any help with the code, nor the engine whatsoever.

Magneteria is a simple game prototype, in which your goal is to advance through levels, by lock-picking doors, solving small puzzle-based tasks, avoiding the guards, which move back and forth, and also avoiding security cameras.
